If you're here, on Github, reading about an extension that customizes Chrome's Developer Tools UI, it stands to reason you probably know some shit about how things work. And since you had to enable an experimental flag to even know what the fuck a Developer Tools UI theme is/does, it also stands to reason that you know:

* Google Chrome updates early and often.

* This can break things.

* Especially extensions like this one.

Ergo, future Chrome updates will absolutely break some of the theme's code. When that happens, I'll get around to updating the CSS files whenever I god damn feel like it. If this timeline doesn't work for you, feel free to clone/download the repo and have at it using the gulpfile contained therein, or modify shit to use your own SCSS compiling setup. Or don't. What the fuck do I care.

Someday, I'll get around to tidying up every line of SCSS, actually maintaining the repo, and providing some better documentation, or at least documentation that's less condescending and rude.

Until that time, I am in no way responsible for any catastrophic problems caused by running this dodgy code in your pretentious development environment.
